## Canon and purpose

- **Primary text:** Joshua 1–24
- **Core question:** *Will courage remain rooted in instruction rather than conquest for its own sake?*
- **Format:** interactive comic with SVG background and foreground layers, optional Three.js middle ground, then character and dialogue overlays.
- **Rule:** Scripture controls plot outcomes. Player choices change participation, viewpoint, pacing, or reflection—not the canonical event.

## Visual language

Use readable silhouettes, hand-made material texture, restrained parallax, and one clear focal action per panel. Background SVG establishes place and weather; middle-ground 3D is reserved for spatial play or a tactile hero prop; foreground SVG frames depth and interaction. Keep violence non-gratuitous and never turn suffering into spectacle.

## Character canon

| Asset key | Character | Continuity note |
|---|---|---|
| `joshua` | Joshua | Supporting visual identity must remain consistent across chapters. |
| `caleb` | Caleb | Supporting visual identity must remain consistent across chapters. |
| `rahab` | Rahab | Supporting visual identity must remain consistent across chapters. |
| `achan` | Achan | Supporting visual identity must remain consistent across chapters. |
| `eleazar` | Eleazar | Supporting visual identity must remain consistent across chapters. |
| `israelite_scout` | Israelite Scout | Supporting visual identity must remain consistent across chapters. |
| `gibeonite` | Gibeonite | Supporting visual identity must remain consistent across chapters. |
| `tribal_leader` | Tribal Leader | Supporting visual identity must remain consistent across chapters. |

The matching presets in `tools/character_presets.js` and `tools/character_presets.json` are the canonical tool inventory. Add a character here first, then add the same key to both preset files.

## Material canon

| Texture key | Material | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `stone` | Stone | Environment, prop, costume, or symbolic surface used by this story. |
| `wall_brick` | Wall Brick | Environment, prop, costume, or symbolic surface used by this story. |
| `desert_sand` | Desert Sand | Environment, prop, costume, or symbolic surface used by this story. |
| `water_fast` | Water Fast | Environment, prop, costume, or symbolic surface used by this story. |
| `fabric_weave` | Fabric Weave | Environment, prop, costume, or symbolic surface used by this story. |
| `wood_dark` | Wood Dark | Environment, prop, costume, or symbolic surface used by this story. |

The matching Texture Forge exposes only these keys. Add a material here before exposing it in the tool.

## Interaction and accessibility

- Every chapter must work with pointer, keyboard, and touch.
- Never make precise timing the only route forward; include retry and reduced-motion behaviour.
- Caption all essential audio information and keep text readable over every layer.
- Keep chapter completion local and recoverable; no choice should erase story access.

## Production contract

Each chapter ships with story JSON, one background SVG, one foreground SVG, and—only where spatial interaction adds value—a small 3D scene module/data file. Asset names use stable lowercase snake_case keys. The game plan is the chapter-level authority for the playable action.

<!-- panel-scene-design:start -->
## Comic panel and scene direction

This is the canonical visual storyboard for production. Each chapter uses three principal panels: **A establishes**, **B carries the interaction**, and **C resolves and reflects**. Additional dialogue panels inherit the nearest principal panel’s palette, lighting, layers, lens, and motion; they may change character pose and caption placement but must not invent a new visual language without updating this document.

### Layer and motion contract

- **Background — SVG:** setting, sky, distant architecture/landscape, weather, and the lowest-frequency parallax. Never place an essential interactive target here.
- **Middle ground — characters + optional 3D:** the narrative action and at most one tactile hero prop. Use 3D only where depth improves the chapter action.
- **Foreground — SVG:** close framing shapes, symbolic props, atmosphere, and occasional occlusion. Foreground motion must not obscure faces, captions, or targets.
- **Camera:** text panels remain stable. Movement is slow, eased, and motivated by revelation, travel, or completion. Avoid continuous orbit, handheld shake, and large zooms.
- **Animation:** SVG and 3D movement starts at different phases so the scene feels layered. Pause nonessential loops while a choice is open. Provide a reduced-motion crossfade/pose alternative.
- **Approved Texture Forge inventory:** `stone`, `wall_brick`, `desert_sand`, `water_fast`, `fabric_weave`, `wood_dark`. Scene rows use only these keys; generated SVGs should preserve the key in filenames or metadata.

### Act 1: Be Strong

**Act summary:** Meditate on the instruction before crossing.

| Panel | Function | Colour and lighting | Texture Forge keys | Composition and layers | Camera angle and movement | SVG and 3D animation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01A | Establish | parchment cream, earth umber, muted teal, restrained gold. clear directional key with soft fill and readable silhouettes. | `stone` + `wall_brick` | Wide, three-plane tableau. FG SVG: framing stone, nearby silhouettes, and an edge prop tied to “be strong”. MG: character group and optional low-detail 3D landmark. BG SVG: layered landscape or architecture specific to the scripture setting. Keep the objective in the brightest third. | Wide 28–35 mm equivalent, slightly above eye level. subtle parallax drift with a short eased push at the narrative turn. | SVG: atmosphere and cloth use slow staggered loops. 3D: one tactile hero prop carries the interaction; all secondary motion remains quiet. Characters begin in readable held poses before any movement. |
| 01B | Interact | Increase local contrast around the action while retaining parchment cream, earth umber, muted teal, restrained gold. Key light follows the story’s real light source. | `wall_brick` + `desert_sand` | Medium action composition with a clear left-to-right path. FG SVG: hands, cloth, foliage, masonry, or tool silhouette that frames—but never covers—the target. MG 3D: the single tactile object required to “meditate on the instruction before crossing”. BG SVG: simplified layered landscape or architecture specific to the scripture setting with reduced saturation. | 40–55 mm equivalent at character/chest height; no free orbit during text. Use a small pointer-linked parallax shift, then an 8–12% eased push when the action completes. | SVG target gets a slow 1–2 px invitation pulse until input; atmosphere continues at half speed. 3D interaction uses anticipation, contact, settle, and a clear final pose. Respect reduced-motion by crossfading between start/end states. |
| 01C | Resolve / reflect | Let the accent move toward a quieter parchment cream, earth umber, muted teal, restrained gold; lower saturation behind captions and preserve warm skin tones. | `desert_sand` + `stone` | Balanced medium-wide aftermath. FG SVG: the chapter’s symbolic object as a corner frame. MG: characters separated into a clean emotional silhouette; 3D hero prop is at rest. BG SVG: layered landscape or architecture specific to the scripture setting, opened to leave negative space for the scripture reference. | 50 mm equivalent near eye level. Hold still for the canonical line, then pull back 5–8% or tilt gently toward the next journey direction. | SVG movement decelerates and settles; one symbolic element may continue looping. 3D elements stop before the scripture reference appears. Transition out with a 350–500 ms layer crossfade, not a hard cut. |

Use a small pointer-linked parallax shift, then an 8–12% eased push when the action completes. | SVG target gets a slow 1–2 px invitation pulse until input; atmosphere continues at half speed. 3D interaction uses anticipation, contact, settle, and a clear final pose. Respect reduced-motion by crossfading between start/end states. |
| 10C | Resolve / reflect | Let the accent move toward a quieter midnight violet, ultramarine, pale cyan, star gold; lower saturation behind captions and preserve warm skin tones. | `wood_dark` + `wall_brick` | Balanced medium-wide aftermath. FG SVG: the chapter’s symbolic object as a corner frame. MG: characters separated into a clean emotional silhouette; 3D hero prop is at rest. BG SVG: abstract horizon, layered cloud, and symbolic light field, opened to leave negative space for the scripture reference. | 50 mm equivalent near eye level. Hold still for the canonical line, then pull back 5–8% or tilt gently toward the next journey direction. | SVG movement decelerates and settles; one symbolic element may continue looping. 3D elements stop before the scripture reference appears. Transition out with a 350–500 ms layer crossfade, not a hard cut. |

### Panel acceptance checklist

A panel is ready only when its background, middle ground, and foreground are individually toggleable; its listed textures are used consistently; text remains readable at mobile width; the camera settles before dialogue; interactive 3D objects have a clear resting state; SVG loops are seamless; and reduced-motion mode communicates the same story beat.
