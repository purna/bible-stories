## Canon and purpose

- **Primary text:** Esther 1–10
- **Core question:** *Will hidden identity become courageous advocacy at the right moment?*
- **Format:** interactive comic with SVG background and foreground layers, optional Three.js middle ground, then character and dialogue overlays.
- **Rule:** Scripture controls plot outcomes. Player choices change participation, viewpoint, pacing, or reflection—not the canonical event.

## Visual language

Use readable silhouettes, hand-made material texture, restrained parallax, and one clear focal action per panel. Background SVG establishes place and weather; middle-ground 3D is reserved for spatial play or a tactile hero prop; foreground SVG frames depth and interaction. Keep violence non-gratuitous and never turn suffering into spectacle.

## Character canon

| Asset key | Character | Continuity note |
|---|---|---|
| `esther` | Esther | Supporting visual identity must remain consistent across chapters. |
| `mordecai` | Mordecai | Supporting visual identity must remain consistent across chapters. |
| `ahasuerus` | Ahasuerus | Supporting visual identity must remain consistent across chapters. |
| `vashti` | Vashti | Supporting visual identity must remain consistent across chapters. |
| `haman` | Haman | Supporting visual identity must remain consistent across chapters. |
| `zeresh` | Zeresh | Supporting visual identity must remain consistent across chapters. |
| `hathach` | Hathach | Supporting visual identity must remain consistent across chapters. |
| `palace_guard` | Palace Guard | Supporting visual identity must remain consistent across chapters. |

The matching presets in `tools/character_presets.js` and `tools/character_presets.json` are the canonical tool inventory. Add a character here first, then add the same key to both preset files.

## Material canon

| Texture key | Material | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `mosaic` | Mosaic | Environment, prop, costume, or symbolic surface used by this story. |
| `hammered_gold` | Hammered Gold | Environment, prop, costume, or symbolic surface used by this story. |
| `fabric_weave` | Fabric Weave | Environment, prop, costume, or symbolic surface used by this story. |
| `fabric_dots` | Fabric Dots | Environment, prop, costume, or symbolic surface used by this story. |
| `stone` | Stone | Environment, prop, costume, or symbolic surface used by this story. |
| `wood_dark` | Wood Dark | Environment, prop, costume, or symbolic surface used by this story. |

The matching Texture Forge exposes only these keys. Add a material here before exposing it in the tool.

## Interaction and accessibility

- Every chapter must work with pointer, keyboard, and touch.
- Never make precise timing the only route forward; include retry and reduced-motion behaviour.
- Caption all essential audio information and keep text readable over every layer.
- Keep chapter completion local and recoverable; no choice should erase story access.

## Production contract

Each chapter ships with story JSON, one background SVG, one foreground SVG, and—only where spatial interaction adds value—a small 3D scene module/data file. Asset names use stable lowercase snake_case keys. The game plan is the chapter-level authority for the playable action.

<!-- panel-scene-design:start -->
## Comic panel and scene direction

This is the canonical visual storyboard for production. Each chapter uses three principal panels: **A establishes**, **B carries the interaction**, and **C resolves and reflects**. Additional dialogue panels inherit the nearest principal panel’s palette, lighting, layers, lens, and motion; they may change character pose and caption placement but must not invent a new visual language without updating this document.

### Layer and motion contract

- **Background — SVG:** setting, sky, distant architecture/landscape, weather, and the lowest-frequency parallax. Never place an essential interactive target here.
- **Middle ground — characters + optional 3D:** the narrative action and at most one tactile hero prop. Use 3D only where depth improves the chapter action.
- **Foreground — SVG:** close framing shapes, symbolic props, atmosphere, and occasional occlusion. Foreground motion must not obscure faces, captions, or targets.
- **Camera:** text panels remain stable. Movement is slow, eased, and motivated by revelation, travel, or completion. Avoid continuous orbit, handheld shake, and large zooms.
- **Animation:** SVG and 3D movement starts at different phases so the scene feels layered. Pause nonessential loops while a choice is open. Provide a reduced-motion crossfade/pose alternative.
- **Approved Texture Forge inventory:** `mosaic`, `hammered_gold`, `fabric_weave`, `fabric_dots`, `stone`, `wood_dark`. Scene rows use only these keys; generated SVGs should preserve the key in filenames or metadata.

### Act 1: The Banquet

**Act summary:** Navigate the palace feast and hear Vashti’s refusal.

| Panel | Function | Colour and lighting | Texture Forge keys | Composition and layers | Camera angle and movement | SVG and 3D animation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01A | Establish | lapis blue, royal plum, limestone, hammered gold. high clerestory or lamp light with sharp architectural shadow. | `mosaic` + `hammered_gold` | Wide, three-plane tableau. FG SVG: framing mosaic, nearby silhouettes, and an edge prop tied to “the banquet”. MG: character group and optional low-detail 3D landmark. BG SVG: columns, patterned wall, and distant court silhouettes. Keep the objective in the brightest third. | Wide 28–35 mm equivalent, slightly above eye level. formal dolly-in with a slight off-axis shift when power is challenged. | SVG: banners, curtain edges, and lamp glow breathe subtly. 3D: throne, table, seal, or architectural hero object moves only when handled. Characters begin in readable held poses before any movement. |
| 01B | Interact | Increase local contrast around the action while retaining lapis blue, royal plum, limestone, hammered gold. Key light follows the story’s real light source. | `hammered_gold` + `fabric_weave` | Medium action composition with a clear left-to-right path. FG SVG: hands, cloth, foliage, masonry, or tool silhouette that frames—but never covers—the target. MG 3D: the single tactile object required to “navigate the palace feast and hear vashti’s refusal”. BG SVG: simplified columns, patterned wall, and distant court silhouettes with reduced saturation. | 40–55 mm equivalent at character/chest height; no free orbit during text. Use a small pointer-linked parallax shift, then an 8–12% eased push when the action completes. | SVG target gets a slow 1–2 px invitation pulse until input; atmosphere continues at half speed. 3D interaction uses anticipation, contact, settle, and a clear final pose. Respect reduced-motion by crossfading between start/end states. |
| 01C | Resolve / reflect | Let the accent move toward a quieter lapis blue, royal plum, limestone, hammered gold; lower saturation behind captions and preserve warm skin tones. | `fabric_weave` + `mosaic` | Balanced medium-wide aftermath. FG SVG: the chapter’s symbolic object as a corner frame. MG: characters separated into a clean emotional silhouette; 3D hero prop is at rest. BG SVG: columns, patterned wall, and distant court silhouettes, opened to leave negative space for the scripture reference. | 50 mm equivalent near eye level. Hold still for the canonical line, then pull back 5–8% or tilt gently toward the next journey direction. | SVG movement decelerates and settles; one symbolic element may continue looping. 3D elements stop before the scripture reference appears. Transition out with a 350–500 ms layer crossfade, not a hard cut. |

MG 3D: the single tactile object required to “assemble gifts, food, and remembrance for every district”. BG SVG: simplified layered landscape or architecture specific to the scripture setting with reduced saturation. | 40–55 mm equivalent at character/chest height; no free orbit during text. Use a small pointer-linked parallax shift, then an 8–12% eased push when the action completes. | SVG target gets a slow 1–2 px invitation pulse until input; atmosphere continues at half speed. 3D interaction uses anticipation, contact, settle, and a clear final pose. Respect reduced-motion by crossfading between start/end states. |
| 10C | Resolve / reflect | Let the accent move toward a quieter parchment cream, earth umber, muted teal, restrained gold; lower saturation behind captions and preserve warm skin tones. | `stone` + `fabric_weave` | Balanced medium-wide aftermath. FG SVG: the chapter’s symbolic object as a corner frame. MG: characters separated into a clean emotional silhouette; 3D hero prop is at rest. BG SVG: layered landscape or architecture specific to the scripture setting, opened to leave negative space for the scripture reference. | 50 mm equivalent near eye level. Hold still for the canonical line, then pull back 5–8% or tilt gently toward the next journey direction. | SVG movement decelerates and settles; one symbolic element may continue looping. 3D elements stop before the scripture reference appears. Transition out with a 350–500 ms layer crossfade, not a hard cut. |

### Panel acceptance checklist

A panel is ready only when its background, middle ground, and foreground are individually toggleable; its listed textures are used consistently; text remains readable at mobile width; the camera settles before dialogue; interactive 3D objects have a clear resting state; SVG loops are seamless; and reduced-motion mode communicates the same story beat.
